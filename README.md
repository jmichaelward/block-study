# Block Study
The 5.0 release of WordPress debuted in December 2018, and with it comes
a brand new editor called Gutenberg. The purpose of this project is
to serve as a study on how to register custom blocks with the new editor,
including default methodologies provided by WordPress, and alternate
methodologies provided by third-party plugins such as Advanced Custom
Fields Pro.
